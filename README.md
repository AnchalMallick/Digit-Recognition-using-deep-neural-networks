A 3 layered deep neural network is built from scratch and trained on a subset of MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The code depicts how differernt modules like the forward propagation unit, backpropagation unit, different activation functions like sigmoid and relu, etc. come together to form a neural network model.All these modules are coded from scratch in this project. The learning curve depicts a pictorial view of how the cost function minimizes after every iteration.Accuracies of 97.205% and 93.98% are achieved on the training and the test set repectively.
